# Modifyworld

Modifyworld is a permission-based world protection Minecraft plugin providing a level of user-specific, fine-grained control not offered by any other plugin by using permissions nodes as its primary method of access configuration. Restriction of almost every aspect of the game is supported.

This fork updates the original plugin to be compatible with recent Spigot releases. Supports 1.14 at the time of writing.
